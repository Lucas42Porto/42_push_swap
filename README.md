# 42_push_swap

## 🛠️ Project Overview:

 Stack A: Holds the list of numbers that need sorting.

 Stack B: An auxiliary stack that starts empty, aiding in the sorting process.
 
The mission: Transfer numbers between these stacks using specific operations to achieve a sorted sequence in ascending order.

## 🌟 The Challenge:

The real test was optimizing the sorting process while strictly following the movement rules. It required strategic planning and precise execution to get everything sorted efficiently.

## 📊 Graphical Visualization:

One of the most exciting parts of this project was creating a graphical visualization of the sorting process. This visualization not only helped me better understand the efficiency of the algorithm but also provided a clear and engaging way to see the code in action!

## Bonus 
For the bonus, we are challenged to create a checker to validate the sorting instructions generated by our program.
